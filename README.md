# E-Ticketing Project

## Overview
The E-Ticketing Database Management System is designed to facilitate ticket management for events or transportation services. It provides a centralized database to manage customer information, ticket sales, and reservations, while ensuring data integrity and efficient querying.

## Technologies
The following technologies will be used in the development of the project:

- **MySQL**: A relational database management system to store user information, event details, ticket availability, and transactions.
- **HTML/CSS**: For creating the front-end user interface and styling the web pages.
- **JavaScript**: To add interactivity to the user interface and manage client-side functionality.
- **Node.js**: To build the back-end server, handling requests and responses between the client and database.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js to simplify the server development process.
- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, providing a responsive and dynamic user experience.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For secure user authentication and authorization.
